## Architecture
The architecture of this app is complies with each of 3 following points:
- [Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)](https://proandroiddev.com/understanding-mvvm-pattern-for-android-in-2021-98b155b37b54) by utilizing the ViewModel in this architecture, you can achieve a more modular, testable, and maintainable codebase, with improved separation of concerns and a clear distinction between UI and business logic/data operations.
- [Modular app architecture](https://developer.android.com/topic/modularization) enables the development of features in isolation, independent of other features. This approach offers benefits such as reusability, scalability, maintainability, reduced app size, and easier modification or replacement of specific features. 
- [Clean Architecture](https://proandroiddev.com/kotlin-clean-architecture-1ad42fcd97fa) strictly emphasizes a clear separation of concerns through distinct architectural layers: Presentation/UI layer, Domain layer, and Data layer. This separation facilitates writing tests without dependencies on external frameworks or UI components, enhancing testability.

## Modules

Above graph shows the app modular structure.
- The `:app` module has a direct dependency on the `:core` module. Additionally, `:app` indirectly depends on the `:feature` module 
- `:feature` modules depends on `:core`, and `utility`.
- Both `:core` and `:app` modules may have dependencies on the `:utility` module, but only if there is a need for specific utilities.
- The `:utility` module does not have any external dependencies.
<br></br>
This architecture promotes modularity and encapsulation by separating functionality into distinct modules. It allows for easier maintenance, reuse of modules across projects, and better management of dependencies between modules.
